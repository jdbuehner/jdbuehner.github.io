        <h2 id="basics">basics of design</h2>
        <h5>March 23rd, 2020</h6>
        
        <p>The fundamentals of design are color theory, the grid, spacing and typography. A web designer is responsible for creating the overall vison of what websites and mobile apps will look like. This includes a site's layout, color, palette, fonts, icons, buttons and visual themes. </p>
        
        <h2 id="history"> twentieth-century design history</h2>
        <h5> March 24th, 2020</h6>
        <p> The major movements of the 20th century that are relevant to web design are Bauhaus, Brutalism and Dada. 
        <p>The Bauhaus school, located in Germany, encouraged its students to be hands-on and experimental. It was here that the well known saying, "form follows function" originatd. Bauhaus influenced web design in many ways, including: establishing visual hierarchy, using color as meaning, selecting legible typography, working in a grid system and making websites that directly respond to the user's needs.
        <p>Brutalism was an architectural movement that encorporated repeating geometric forms, overt building materials and a utilitarian ethos. It influenced web designers to put the user's needs first, make things efficient yet beautiful, produce designs of integrity and maintain what you've built.
        <h2 id="website"> contemporary website design</h2>
        <h5> March 25th, 2020</h6>
        <p> Web design is the process of mapping otu the look and feel of the content that people view and interact with on a computer, table or phone screen.
        <p> This includes: the website's aesthetics, site navigation, mocking up sites to look good on screens of all sizes, coding pages or using languages like HTML and CSS and managing clients and their projects.
        <h2 id="UX"> basics of user experience</h2>
        <h5> March 26th, 2020</h6>
        <p> User experience, or UX, comprises researching a web user's experiences with digital products and using that research to create designs that improve the user's experience. UX design is less about the "look" of a digital product and more about the "feel". It can apply to websites, mobile apps and how websites are experience on other digital devices.
        <h2 id="logo"> logo design</h2>
        <h5> March 27th, 2020</h6>
        <p> A good logo should accomplish the brand goals and appeal to a target audience. A logo is comprised of typography, graphics and a color scheme. 
<p>The first thing a designer should do is reserach the client's company and competition. A designer can then use design principles to craft a logo that is distinct, relevant, simple, timeless and adaptive.
